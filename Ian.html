        <h2>Lich King</h2>
        <p>The Lich King was the master and lord of the Scourge which he ruled telepathically through the Helm of Domination from his Frozen Throne atop Icecrown Citadel.

            Kil'jaeden the Deceiver created the original Lich King from the spirit of the orc shaman Ner'zhul for the purpose of raising an undead army to weaken Azeroth in preparation for the Burning Legion's invasion. Initially trapped within the Frozen Throne with Frostmourne, the Lich King eventually betrayed Kil'jaeden and merged with the human Arthas Menethil. At the climax of the war for Northrend, Arthas the Lich King was defeated by Highlord Tirion Fordring and his champions. After the destruction of Frostmourne and the death of Arthas, Bolvar Fordragon became the new Lich King in order to keep the undead Scourge in check. Bolvar was later defeated by Sylvanas Windrunner who also destroyed the Helm of Domination, making the position of Lich King come to an end.
            
            The Lich King Arthas was the titular antagonist of World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King..</p>

        <h2>Illidan Stormrage</h2>
        <p>Born a night elf and sorcerer, his pursuit of power led him to commit several horrific acts against his own people,[1] which earned him the nickname "the Betrayer" and to become the first Demon Hunter. Self-proclaimed the Lord of Outland, he joined the Burning Legion and became a partial demon himself as part of a plan to destroy the Legion from within. Illidan also appears as a playable character in the crossover multiplayer online battle arena game Heroes of the Storm. The character is one of the most notable and popular in the Warcraft franchise and has received positive critical reception from video game players. Illidan was voiced by Matthew Yang King in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion The Frozen Throne, and by Liam O'Brien since World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.</p>

    <section id="Deathwing">
        <h2>Deathwing</h2>
        <p>Deathwing the Destroyer,[6] formerly known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder (pronounced /nɛɫˈθærɪən/ "nel-THARR-ree-uhn"),<br> was one of the five Dragon Aspects and leader of the black dragonflight. Ages ago, Neltharion was empowered by the Pantheon with dominion over the earth and the deep places of Azeroth. However, driven mad by the Old Gods, he turned against the other Aspects during the War of the Ancients,[7] eventually abandoning his title of Aspect of Earth in favor of being the Aspect of Death.[8][9] Becoming one of the greatest terrors of the known world, his name too became one whispered with a feeling of fear and contempt among both mortals and dragons.[10] He was perhaps the most powerful servant of the Old Gods.</p>
