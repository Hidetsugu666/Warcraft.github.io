                <p>High Exarch Turalyon is one of the first five paladins of the Knights of the Silver Hand along with Uther the Lightbringer, Saidan Dathrohan, Tirion Fordring, and Gavinrad the Dire. Contrary to the other paladins, Turalyon was previously a priest rather than a warrior. Serving the Alliance army with distinction during and immediately after the Second War, he was second in command to Lord Anduin Lothar, the Supreme Allied Commander.</p>

                <p>Velen has been the leader of the draenei people since their flight from Argus 13,000 years[12] before the first orcish invasion of Azeroth. Known by his people as the Prophet, he has been granted the gift of the Sight, and — aided by the Light — rejected offers of dark power from Sargeras and has guided his people as they fled from, and later fought against, the Burning Legion and their former eredar brethren.</p>
